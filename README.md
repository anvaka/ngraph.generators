Graph generators
=================
This module generates various graphs. It is part of larger [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph)
family. If you something not as simple as generated graphs, please check out
[ngraph.sparce-collection](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.sparse-collection) repository
which contains graphs from University of Florida collection.

# Supported graphs

## Ladder

``` js
// Creates a ladder with 10 steps
var graph = require('ngraph.generators').ladder(10);
```

var graph = require('ngraph.generators').grid(10, 10);
```

var graph = require('ngraph.generators').noLinks(100);;
```

## WattsStrogatz

This is a "small world" random graph, generated by [Watts and Strogatz model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts_and_Strogatz_model).
In this model generator takes three arguments:

* `n` - number of nodes
* `k` - number of edges for each node. Originally node is connected with `k` nearest neighbours on a circle graph
* `b` - probabilty of an edge rewrite. In other words node changes it's nearest neighbor to a random
node inside graph with probability `b`.

``` js
// Creates graph with 100 nodes, each node is connected with 20 neighbours,
// and probability of neighbour to be outside of local node community is 1%.
var g1 = require('ngraph.generators').wattsStrogatz(100, 20, 0.00);
var g2 = require('ngraph.generators').wattsStrogatz(100, 20, 0.01);
var g3 = require('ngraph.generators').wattsStrogatz(100, 20, 0.10);
var g4 = require('ngraph.generators').wattsStrogatz(100, 20, 0.50);
var g5 = require('ngraph.generators').wattsStrogatz(20, 4, 0.02);
```
